# TODO: Ensure Fares Display in Rand

## Tasks
- [x] Update route tags in rank cards to display fares as (R{fare})
- [x] Update route tags in modal details to display fares as (R{fare})
- [x] Test the changes by running the app and verifying fare display

## Notes
- Changes are in src/components/UserApp/UserApp.jsx
- Fares are shown in two places: rank card route tags and modal route tags
- Prefix fare with "R" to indicate South African Rand
